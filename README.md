This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app), including Typescript and TailwindCSS.

It uses [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/current) to show the current weather data in a city.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Add your OpenWeather API key to your .env file to access the data.
